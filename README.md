# Balachrom ONE
A Balatro modpack, co-project of [Balasclo](https://github.com/ChromaPIE/Balasclo) (Balatro Simplified Chinese Localization Overhaul).

Likewise, Balachrom ONE is as well dedicated for Modded Balatro gameplay in said language, yet eventually, by grace of the newly introduced localization update of Steamodded 1.0, this modpack will hopefully be available for both languages in the future. (i mean if them mod devs could do the migration asap)
